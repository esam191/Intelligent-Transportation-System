Because we cannot upload files (or the activity doesnt necessarily ask us to), I have added here the link to access gCloudStorage URI
gs://cloudcomputing-345522-gs

The folder attached is has all the files from cloud storage. Used command below to copy and download the entire folder.
 
gsutil -m cp -r \
  "gs://cloudcomputing-345522-gs/input" \
  "gs://cloudcomputing-345522-gs/model" \
  "gs://cloudcomputing-345522-gs/output" \
  "gs://cloudcomputing-345522-gs/result" \
  "gs://cloudcomputing-345522-gs/staging" \
  "gs://cloudcomputing-345522-gs/temp" \
  "gs://cloudcomputing-345522-gs/tmp" \
